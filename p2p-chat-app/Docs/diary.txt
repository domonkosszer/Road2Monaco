27.5.25
So we started working on the new Project. It is a P2P Chat App. The first step is to create a terminal-based version
of what we want to achieve. We will use python for this. We started to create our first class named peer. This class
will be responsible for handling the peer's information. It will represent a user/device in our P2P network.
It has a unique ID, a list of connected peers, a username, a host IP and a port number.
